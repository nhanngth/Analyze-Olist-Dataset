# Olist Dataset Analysis
If you do not have Tableau, please visit my project's [link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nhan.nguyen5609/viz/TheStoryofCustomers/OlistCustomersStory) 

**Analyzing the dataset by splitting customers into two groups: 10 percent of customers with the highest revenue and the remaining.**

## Purpose
This project is created for the purpose of practicing and enhancing Python, Tableau skills and business sense by cleaning, preparing the dataset, modelling, creating visualization and finding insights.
By figuring out these insights, I attempt to propose some ideas based on my point of view and my knowledge to improve the performance of the company.

## Data source
The data that I used for analyzing comes from **Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist**, which is provided by Olist, an e-commerce website founded in Brazil. The dataset can be obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce?resource=download). In addition, lists of Brazilâ€™s states, cities, municipalities and population can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page). 

## Main materials
* [Raw Dataset](https://github.com/nhanngth/Analyze-Olist-Dataset/tree/main/Olist%20Raw%20Dataset)
* [Cleaned Dataset](https://github.com/nhanngth/Analyze-Olist-Dataset/tree/main/Cleaned%20Dataset)
* [The List of All Cities and Municipalities in Brazil](https://github.com/nhanngth/Analyze-Olist-Dataset/blob/main/Get%20list%20of%20all%20cities.ipynb)
* [Data Cleaning Notebook](https://github.com/nhanngth/Analyze-Olist-Dataset/blob/main/Olist%20Dataset%20Cleaning.ipynb)
* [The Story of Customers](https://github.com/nhanngth/Analyze-Olist-Dataset/blob/main/The%20Story%20of%20Customers.twbx)

## Some proposals
Base on the insights found out from Olist dataset, I suggest some ideas as below:
* The top 10 percent of customers contribute approximate 25% to total revenue. They should be focused on.
* Paying by credit card is the most popular method that people in Brazil use. The system should be upgraded and maintained to keep the process of paying by credit card stable.
* Vouchers have a significant impact on the increasing of revenue and the number of orders. It can be considered for flexible uses in big campaigns in order to make the revenue go up.
* Customers in the group of top 10 percent tend to be attracted by the stability of price and freight. They prefer to buy products which have competitive prices rather than seek for expensive ones. We can improve the way that these products appear or adjust marketing campaigns.
* Bed bath table, sports leisure and health beauty are most popular categories that generate a vast amount of revenue. They should be focused on.
* People buy products with many images more than the others. I suggest encouraging the sellers to add more product images to their own pages.
* Sales should be promoted in order to get more customers who live in big cities.
* The key of improving ratings of products is cutting off delivery time.
