# Olist Dataset Analysis

## Purpose
This project is created for the purpose of practicing and enhancing Python, Tableau skills and business sense by cleaning, preparing the dataset, modelling, creating visualization and finding insights.
By figuring out these insights, I attempt to propose some ideas based on my point of view and my knowledge to promote the performance of the company.

## Datasource
Data that I used for analyzing comes from **Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist**, which is provided by Olist, an e-commerce website founded in Brazil. The dataset can be obtained from [Kaggle] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce?resource=download). In addition, lists of Brazilâ€™s states, cities, municipalities and population can be found on [Wikipedia] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page).
